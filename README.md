# Reddit-Background

The purpose of this project is to create a Python script to set desktop backgrounds from images downloaded from Reddit.

## There are two scripts:

The 'script.py' is the advanced version with controls.

The 'script_2.py' is the basic version which takes an image at random and sets it as desktop background.





### This is a work in progress.
